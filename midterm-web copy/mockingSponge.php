              <h1 class="">Origin</h1>
              <p class="">The image of SpongeBob used for this series comes from the episode of the animated comedy series SpongeBob SquarePants called “Little Yellow Book,” which first aired on November 25th, 2012. In the episode, Squidward reads SpongeBob’s diary, where he discovers that whenever SpongeBob sees plaid, he acts like a chicken. The earliest iteration of the scene being used as a meme occurred on May 4th, 2017. Twitter user @OGBEARD posted a screenshot of the scene where SpongeBob acts like a chicken with the caption “How i stare back at little kids when they stare for too long.” The tweet has received more than 73,000 retweets and 147,300 likes in five days.</p>

              <p class="">On May 5th, Twitter user @lexysaeyang posted the same screenshot, adding a call-and-response element to the meme, creating the effect that SpongeBob’s face and the alternation of uppercase and lowercase text represents a mocking tone. The tweet, which put the SpongeBob picture next to a picture of a bird with arms, received more than 37,100 retweets and 86,600 likes.</p>
